This is my final project for the Arkansas Coding Academy

It is an application to be used by small business owners in the landscape construction industry. Via the foreman interface, data is uploaded to the database (e.g. crew hours, equipment time, photos) to provide up-to-date metrics of production and keep track of machine maintenance. Via the project manager interface, all data to make effective daily, weekly, and monthly decisions is available through use of charts, maps of crew locations, and views of uploaded photos of projects.
